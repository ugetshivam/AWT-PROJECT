                For many months now, our team at BioWare has been hard at work
                updating the textures, shaders, models, effects and technical
                features of three enormous games. Our goal was not to remake or
                reimagine the original games, but to modernize the experience so
                that fans and new players can experience the original work in
                its best possible form. It's been amazing to see the adventures
                of Commander Shepard take on new life in super-sharp resolution,
                faster framerates, and beautiful visual enhancements. Mass
                Effect Legendary Edition will include single-player base content
                and DLC from Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2, and Mass Effect 3, plus
                promo weapons, armors, and packs - all remastered and optimized
                for 4k Ultra HD. It will be available in Spring 2021 for Xbox
                One, PlayStation 4, and PC, with forward compatibility and
                targeted enhancements on Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5.

                You seek untold riches, eternal life, divine powers -- it leads
                to this accursed temple, a seemingly-infinite labyrinth of
                bottomless pits, deadly traps, and monsters. Your greed will
                lead you to death, but that is not an escape. Rise to fight
                again. Delve deeper again. Defy the malignant deities that
                linger in this place. Battle through hordes of enemies in dark,
                cavernous passages filled with traps and secrets of all sorts --
                fire-spewing statues, explosives, hidden spikes, and worse.
                Collect mystical Relics and an arsenal of weapons to make
                yourself unstoppable. Corruption builds in you with every step
                -- encourage or ignore it, but each powerful curse can be a
                double-edged sword.
